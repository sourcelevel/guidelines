Git Workflow
============

We follow some patterns on creating branches and this is related to our workflow in `Shortcut`.

If you didn't read [Pull Requests](https://github.com/sourcelevel/guidelines/blob/main/resources/pull_requests.md), we recommend to read it before this guide.

## Branches

We work with a single stable branch: `main`. Everything that is merged into it, we assume that already passed in the `Test phase` properly.

Now that you're familiar with `User Story`, let's understand how it reflects our branches and accordingly to our Pull Requests:

### User Story

#### User Story card

First, we create a branch using `main` as the base with the following pattern:

* `chddd/user-story-card-title`

Where `ddd` stands for Story Card number in Shortcut, check some examples of naming User Story branches:

* `ch897/collect-issues-line-numbers`
* `ch569/edit-reviewer-author`
* `ch642/clustering-contribution-data`

#### More than a single branch

If you realize that a single branch won't be enough, you can create more branches to detail
your work of this User Story card. For example, let us imagine the following scenario:

We have a User Story `Collect issues line numbers` which its number in Shortcut is `123`.

![https://github.com/sourcelevel/guidelines/blob/main/images/user_story_flow.png](https://github.com/sourcelevel/guidelines/blob/main/images/user_story_flow.png)

In this case, we can start creating the branch for it using `main` as the base:

```
git checkout -b ch123/collect-issues-line-numbers
```

After analyzing the requirements we noticed that a single Pull Request would carry too many
changes. So we've decided to break down our changes in n pull requests, to do so we start
creating a new branch using `ch123/collect-issues-line-numbers` as the base, then create the
new one:

```
git checkout -b ch123/xz-add-database-migrations
```

Where `xz` stands for initials of developer, check some examples of naming sub User Story branches:

* `ch321/wt-fix-reviews-count-in-repository-page`
* `ch781/gg-remove-sales-machine-from-subscriptions`

If you developed that change in pair programming, you can use both initials ordered alphabetically:

* `ch821/gg-wt-add-call-to-action-to-landing-page`

Note that you're able to open new branches and Pull Requests as you consider necessary on working in a User Story card.
To decide that, always keep in mind: how easy would be to review your code, so Pull Request size will be your guide.
